# Trackazon

## What is This?

Trackazon is a user friendly way to keep some basic info on the items a user has in their store inventory.  This application is built on a Ruby on Rails backend with a AngularJS front end.

This is my final project for the [Flatiron School's Learn Verified Program](http://learn.co/with/zacscodingclub).
